# Atliq Hardwares Consumer Goods Ad_hoc Insights 
This is a February month  Codebasics Resume Challenge . 

## Challenge 
We have to provide insights to the management in Consumer Goods Domain.

## Project Statement
Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.
